# Infinite-Pops
Your approach: I use Retrofit library to get json data and parse it. I have wrote custom recyclerview (have infinite scroll feature). When position in recylerview is last item, I called onLoadMore function to retrieve next of batch data.

Your library: I choose Retrofit library because it is powerful library to help me get json data and parse it to object. I can handle exception easily.

Issuse: The document wrote 'using at most 1 third-party library' so I have created my ImageLoading control. It does not perform well.
