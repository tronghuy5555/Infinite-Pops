# Infinite-Pops
My approach: I use Retrofit library to get json data and parse it. I have wrote custom recyclerview (have infinite scroll feature). When position in recylerview is last item, I called onLoadMore function to retrieve next of batch data.

My library: I choose Retrofit library because it is powerful library to help me get json data and parse it to object. I can handle exception easily.

Issuse: The document wrote 'using at most a library' so I can not use library for loading image and library for convert gson. The app do not perform well.
